# üîç Perplexity Research Results - Cycle 3

**Generated**: 2025-08-26T12:43:10.384394
**Cycle**: 3/5
**Tasks Completed This Cycle**: 3

EchoTune AI‚Äôs repository and development strategy can be advanced by focusing on codebase optimization, leveraging current AI/ML music trends, enhancing Spotify API integration, improving frontend React performance, and strengthening security and testing. Below are actionable, Copilot-friendly tasks for the next coding cycle, prioritized and mapped to your analysis focus:

---

**1. Codebase Structure & Optimization**
- Refactor large or deeply nested modules into smaller, reusable components (Priority: High).
- Standardize code formatting and enforce linting rules across the repository (Priority: High).
- Remove unused dependencies and dead code to reduce bundle size (Priority: Medium)[2][3].

**2. AI/ML Music Trends & Integration**
- Integrate a lightweight, open-source music genre classification model (e.g., using Hugging Face‚Äôs StarCoder or similar) for real-time track analysis (Priority: High)[3].
- Add hooks for future integration with generative music models (e.g., melody/harmony suggestion APIs) (Priority: Medium).
- Scaffold a plugin interface for third-party AI/ML modules (Priority: Low).

**3. Spotify API Usage Enhancements**
- Refactor Spotify API calls to use batching where possible, reducing rate limit issues (Priority: High).
- Implement caching for frequently accessed Spotify endpoints (e.g., user playlists, track metadata) (Priority: Medium).
- Add error handling and retry logic for all Spotify API interactions (Priority: High).

**4. Frontend React Performance**
- Audit and memoize expensive React components using React.memo and useCallback (Priority: High).
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical UI components (Priority: Medium).
- Replace inline styles with CSS modules or styled-components for better performance (Priority: Medium).

**5. New Features & Roadmap Additions**
- Add user playlist analytics dashboard (Priority: High).
- Implement track recommendation engine using collaborative filtering (Priority: Medium).
- Enable user feedback on AI-generated playlists (Priority: Low).

**6. Architecture & Scalability**
- Modularize backend services for easier scaling (Priority: High).
- Add Dockerfile and basic containerization scripts for local and cloud deployment (Priority: Medium).
- Prepare for horizontal scaling by decoupling stateful and stateless services (Priority: Medium)[4].

**7. Security Enhancements**
- Enforce OAuth token refresh and secure storage for Spotify credentials (Priority: High)[4].
- Add input validation and sanitization for all user-facing endpoints (Priority: High).
- Integrate automated dependency vulnerability scanning (Priority: Medium).

**8. Testing & Validation**
- Increase unit test coverage for core modules (Priority: High).
- Add integration tests for Spotify API workflows (Priority: High).
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated linting, testing, and security checks on pull requests (Priority: High)[3][4].

**9. Documentation Updates**
- Update README with new architecture diagrams and feature descriptions (Priority: High).
- Add API usage examples and endpoint documentation (Priority: Medium).
- Document setup for local development and testing (Priority: Medium).

**All tasks above are suitable for GitHub Copilot automation, especially when paired with clear prompts and code comments.** For best results, break down larger tasks into atomic commits and use Copilot‚Äôs chat features to generate, review, and refactor code as needed[2][3].

**Key priorities for the next cycle:**  
- Refactor and modularize codebase  
- Enhance Spotify API robustness  
- Integrate basic AI/ML music features  
- Improve frontend performance  
- Strengthen security and testing automation

This approach aligns with current best practices in AI-driven code review, DevOps, and scalable, secure application development[3][4].
