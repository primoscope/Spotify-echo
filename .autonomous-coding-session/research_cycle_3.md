- **Automate deployment scripts for scaling microservices** (Priority: Medium)[4].
- **Add roadmap item:** Evaluate on-premise LLM deployment for privacy and compliance (Priority: Low)[3].

### 7. Security Enhancements & Best Practices
- **Automate dependency vulnerability scanning** and patching (Priority: High)[4].
- **Enforce secure API authentication and authorization patterns** (Priority: High)[4].
- **Add supply chain security checks to CI/CD pipeline** (Priority: Medium)[4].

### 8. Testing & Validation Improvements
- **Expand unit and integration test coverage** using Copilot-generated test cases (Priority: High)[4].
- **Automate AI-driven test case generation for edge scenarios** (Priority: Medium)[4].
- **Add continuous testing and resilience checks** (Priority: Medium)[4].
