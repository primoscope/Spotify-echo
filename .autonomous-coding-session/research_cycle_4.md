- **Task:** Add hooks for future integration with third-party AI music APIs.

**3. Spotify API Usage Patterns & Enhancements**
- **Action:** Analyze current API call patterns for redundancy or inefficiency.
- **Task:** Batch Spotify API requests where possible to reduce rate limit issues.
- **Task:** Implement caching for frequently accessed endpoints (e.g., user playlists, track features).

**4. Frontend React Component Performance**
- **Action:** Profile React components for unnecessary re-renders and large bundle sizes.
- **Task:** Refactor class components to functional components with hooks where applicable.
- **Task:** Implement React.memo and useCallback to optimize rendering.
- **Task:** Lazy-load heavy components and assets.

**5. New Features & Roadmap Additions**
- **High Priority:** Add user playlist mood analysis (leveraging AI/ML integration).
- **Medium Priority:** Implement a ‚Äúsmart recommendations‚Äù feature based on listening history and detected moods.
- **Low Priority:** Add a dark mode toggle and accessibility improvements.

**6. Architecture & Scalability Enhancements**
- **Action:** Review current backend and frontend separation.
- **Task:** Containerize backend services with Docker for easier scaling.
- **Task:** Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment and testing[3].
- **Task:** Prepare for horizontal scaling by decoupling stateful services.

**7. Security Enhancements & Best Practices**
- **Action:** Audit for hardcoded secrets and move to environment variables.
- **Task:** Implement input validation and sanitization for all user-facing endpoints.
- **Task:** Add automated dependency vulnerability scanning (e.g., GitHub Dependabot)[3].

**8. Testing & Validation Improvements**
- **Action:** Increase test coverage, focusing on critical business logic and API integrations.
- **Task:** Use Copilot to generate unit and integration tests for uncovered modules.
- **Task:** Set up automated end-to-end testing for key user flows.
- **Task:** Document test cases and expected outcomes.

**9. Documentation Updates**
- **Action:** Auto-generate updated API documentation from code comments.
- **Task:** Add usage examples for new features and endpoints.
- **Task:** Update README with architecture diagrams and setup instructions.

**Notes:**
- All tasks are designed to be compatible with GitHub Copilot‚Äôs automated coding capabilities, focusing on code generation, refactoring, and documentation[1][3].
- Prioritize tasks that improve code quality, performance, and security, as these have the highest impact and automation potential.
- For AI/ML integration, Copilot can scaffold code, but model selection and tuning may require manual oversight.

This strategy ensures EchoTune AI‚Äôs repository remains robust, scalable, and ready for advanced music AI features in the next development cycle.
