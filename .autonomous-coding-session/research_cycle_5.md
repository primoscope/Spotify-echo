**Cycle**: 5/5
**Tasks Completed This Cycle**: 3

EchoTune AI‚Äôs repository can be advanced by focusing on codebase optimization, AI/ML integration, Spotify API usage, frontend performance, feature expansion, architecture, security, and testing. Below are actionable, Copilot-friendly tasks for the next coding cycle, prioritized for automation and impact.

---

**1. Codebase Structure & Optimization**
- Refactor large or deeply nested modules into smaller, single-responsibility files for maintainability and Copilot code navigation[1].
- Standardize code formatting and linting rules (e.g., Prettier, ESLint) across the repository for consistency[1].
- Remove unused dependencies and dead code to reduce technical debt and improve build times[1].

**2. AI/ML Trends & Integration**
- Integrate a lightweight music genre classification model using TensorFlow.js or ONNX for real-time inference in the browser (Priority: High).
- Add support for prompt-based music recommendations using LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) to generate playlist suggestions (Priority: Medium).
- Scaffold a plugin interface for future AI/ML modules, enabling Copilot to auto-generate stubs for new models (Priority: Medium).

**3. Spotify API Usage**
- Refactor Spotify API calls to use async/await and centralized error handling for reliability and Copilot code suggestions[4].
- Implement caching for frequently accessed Spotify endpoints (e.g., track analysis, user playlists) to reduce API rate limits (Priority: High).
- Add automated tests for Spotify integration endpoints using Jest or similar frameworks (Priority: High).

**4. Frontend React Performance**
- Convert class-based components to functional components with hooks for improved performance and Copilot compatibility[1].
- Implement React.memo and useCallback where appropriate to minimize unnecessary re-renders (Priority: High).
- Add lazy loading for heavy components (e.g., waveform visualizations, AI analysis panels) to improve initial load time (Priority: Medium).

**5. New Features & Roadmap**
- Add ‚ÄúAI Mood Tagging‚Äù for tracks/playlists using sentiment analysis (Priority: High).
- Implement ‚ÄúSmart Playlist Merge‚Äù to combine user playlists based on AI similarity scoring (Priority: Medium).
- Scaffold a ‚ÄúUser Insights Dashboard‚Äù with Copilot-generated starter components for future analytics (Priority: Low).

**6. Architecture & Scalability**
- Modularize backend services (e.g., separate AI inference, Spotify integration, and user management) for easier scaling and Copilot-driven code generation[4].
- Add Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for local development and deployment automation (Priority: High).
- Implement environment variable management for secrets and API keys (Priority: High).

**7. Security Enhancements**
- Add input validation and sanitization for all user-facing endpoints (Priority: High)[4].
- Integrate automated dependency vulnerability scanning (e.g., GitHub Dependabot) (Priority: High).
- Enforce HTTPS and secure cookie flags in all web responses (Priority: Medium).

**8. Testing & Validation**
- Increase unit test coverage for core modules, especially AI/ML and Spotify integration (Priority: High)[1].
- Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows using Cypress or Playwright (Priority: Medium).
- Set up code coverage reporting in CI for visibility and Copilot-driven test suggestions (Priority: Medium).

**9. Documentation Updates**
- Auto-generate API documentation using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI for backend endpoints (Priority: High).
- Update README with architecture diagrams and setup instructions, leveraging Copilot for template generation (Priority: Medium).
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md with coding standards and PR guidelines (Priority: Medium).

These tasks are designed for Copilot automation, focusing on code patterns, documentation, and test scaffolding that Copilot can generate or enhance efficiently[3][1][4]. For advanced AI/ML integrations, Copilot can scaffold interfaces and boilerplate, but model selection and fine-tuning may require manual oversight.
