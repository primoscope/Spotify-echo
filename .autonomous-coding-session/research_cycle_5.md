- **Replace deprecated lifecycle methods** with hooks (Medium).
- **Automate bundle analysis and size reduction** (Medium).

### 5. **New Features & Roadmap Additions**
- **Add user playlist sharing and collaboration** (High).
- **Implement AI-powered music recommendations** (Medium).
- **Introduce real-time music visualization** (Low).
- **Enable user feedback collection for recommendations** (Medium).

### 6. **Architecture & Scalability**
- **Adopt microservices or modular monolith patterns** for backend scalability (Medium)[4].
- **Automate deployment scripts for CI/CD integration** (High).
- **Implement horizontal scaling strategies for high-traffic endpoints** (Medium).

### 7. **Security Enhancements**
- **Automate dependency vulnerability scanning** (High)[4].
- **Enforce secure API authentication and authorization patterns** (High).
- **Implement rate limiting and input validation for all endpoints** (Medium).
- **Add automated security testing to CI pipeline** (High)[4].

### 8. **Testing & Validation Improvements**
- **Increase unit and integration test coverage** for critical modules (High).
- **Automate regression testing for frontend and backend** (High)[4].
- **Add end-to-end tests for Spotify integration workflows** (Medium).
- **Integrate AI-powered test case generation** for edge scenarios (Medium)[3].

### 9. **Documentation Updates**
- **Auto-generate API documentation from code comments** (High).
- **Update README with new features and setup instructions** (Medium).
- **Document architecture decisions and scalability strategies** (Medium).

#### **Tasks Suitable for GitHub Copilot Automation**
- Refactoring and modularization of code.
- Adding or updating linting, formatting, and test scripts.
- Implementing caching logic and optimizing API calls.
- Automating documentation generation.
- Adding or updating unit/integration tests.
- Security scanning and basic input validation.
- Profiling and optimizing React components.

**Priority Levels:**  
- **High:** Direct impact on performance, security, or user experience; suitable for Copilot automation.  
- **Medium:** Enhances maintainability, scalability, or feature set; Copilot can assist but may require review.  
- **Low:** Experimental or advanced features; Copilot can scaffold but may need manual refinement.
