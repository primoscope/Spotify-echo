## Task Description
1. Codebase Structure & Optimization
- **Refactor redundant modules and functions** for improved maintainability and readability. Prioritize files with high cyclomatic complexity (Priority: High).
- **Automate code formatting and linting** using tools like Prettier and ESLint, ensuring consistent style across the codebase (Priority: High)[1].
- **Modularize large files** by splitting monolithic components into smaller, reusable units (Priority: Medium).
