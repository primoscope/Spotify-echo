  *Complexity: 4*  
  Upgrade authentication flows to latest security standards; monitor for token misuse and enforce least-privilege access.
- **User Data Privacy & Consent Management**  
  *Complexity: 5*  
  Add granular controls for data sharing, AI personalization, and third-party integrations; support GDPR/CCPA compliance.

**5. Observability, Quality, and DevOps**
- **Distributed Tracing with OpenTelemetry**  
  *Complexity: 5*  
  Instrument all backend and MCP services for end-to-end tracing, latency, and error analysis.
- **Automated Security Scanning (SAST/DAST)**  
  *Complexity: 4*  
  Integrate static and dynamic analysis tools into CI/CD for early vulnerability detection.
- **TypeScript Full Migration**  
  *Complexity: 6*

#### **Implementation Suggestions**

- **Leverage open-source AI music models** (MusicGen, MusicLM, Riffusion) for rapid prototyping; consider hybrid cloud/on-prem deployment for cost and compliance.
- **Adopt React 19 and server components** for frontend modernization, reducing bundle size and improving perceived performance.
- **Integrate OpenTelemetry** across all services for unified observability; export traces to a managed backend (e.g., Grafana, Datadog).
- **Implement watermarking** for all AI-generated audio; display clear attribution and allow users to opt out of AI content in recommendations.
- **Upgrade all OAuth flows** to OAuth 2.1 with PKCE; regularly audit third-party API permissions.
- **Automate security scanning** in CI/CD; enforce code review for all dependency updates.
- **Prioritize TypeScript migration** for backend modules with high change rates and external exposure.

#### **Performance Optimization Opportunities**

- **Edge caching** for static and dynamic assets (audio, recommendations) to reduce global latency.
- **Optimize MongoDB** with compound and TTL indexes for analytics and telemetry data.
- **Adopt event-driven streaming** for real-time recommendations and analytics.
- **Bundle analysis and code splitting** to keep frontend JS payloads minimal.

---

#### **Security Enhancement Recommendations**

- **Watermark and attribute all AI-generated content** to mitigate copyright risk and increase transparency.
- **Upgrade authentication and authorization** to latest standards (OAuth 2.1, PKCE, least-privilege).
- **Implement user-facing privacy controls** for AI personalization and data sharing.
- **Integrate automated security scanning** and enforce dependency hygiene in CI/CD.
