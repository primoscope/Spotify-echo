# Task: Persist Rolling Window Metrics to Redis
# Description: Implement persistence of rolling window API latency and error metrics to Redis for durability and multi-instance aggregation. This will ensure metrics are not lost on server restart and can be aggregated across multiple instances.
# Files to modify: ['scripts/bench/api-latency.js', 'src/api/middleware/metrics.js', 'src/config/redis.js']

# Implementation steps would go here
# For now, create a placeholder implementation
