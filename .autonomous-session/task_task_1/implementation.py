# Task: Persist Rolling Window Metrics to Redis
# Description: Implement persistence of API latency and error metrics to Redis for durability and multi-instance aggregation. This will ensure metrics are not lost on server restart and can be aggregated across multiple instances.
# Files to modify: ['scripts/bench/api-latency.js', 'src/api/routes/performance.js', 'src/utils/metrics.js']
