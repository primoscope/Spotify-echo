# Task: TypeScript Migration Plan for High-Change Backend Modules
# Description: Draft and begin implementing a migration plan to convert backend modules with high change-rate (e.g., src/api/routes/*, src/chat/*) from JavaScript to TypeScript. This will improve code quality and maintainability.
# Files to modify: ['src/api/routes/*', 'src/chat/*', 'tsconfig.json']
