# Task Description
Perplexity api is configured to PERPLEXITY_API_KEY for background agent usage. Begin to Test cursor integration and perplexity integration and analyze other working workflows and configurations, test and validate and fix issues 2. scan the workspace for any configs or code related to Cursor and Perplexity integrations, plus other workflow/config files, to identify what to test. Then I'll run initial validations and iterate on any issues.3. inspect the Perplexity MCP server implementation, Cursor MCP generator (enhanced), test configuration, and orchestrator files to plan the test commands. Then I'll run installs and tests.4. fix a broken test script that references a non-existent file, generate Cursor MCP configuration, then run Perplexity integration tests and MCP performance tests. If anything fails, I'll adjust and re-run.

# Project Overview
EchoTune AI - Advanced Spotify Analytics & Music Discovery Platform with comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, Perplexity API integration, and automated workflow orchestration. The project features extensive testing infrastructure, production deployment automation, and multi-model AI integration for enhanced music discovery and user experience.

# Execution Protocol:

## 1. Create feature branch
1. Create a new task branch from [MAIN_BRANCH]:
  ```
  git checkout -b task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```
2. Add the branch name to the [TASK_FILE] under "Task Branch."
3. Verify the branch is active:
  ```
  git branch --show-current
  ```
4. Update "Current execution step" in [TASK_FILE] to next step

## 2. Create the task file
1. Execute command to generate [TASK_FILE_NAME]:
   ```
   [TASK_FILE_NAME]="$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_$(($(ls -1q .tasks | grep -c $(date +%Y-%m-%d)) + 1))"
   ```
2. Create [TASK_FILE] with strict naming:
   ```
   mkdir -p .tasks && touch ".tasks/${TASK_FILE_NAME}_[TASK_IDENTIFIER].md"
   ```
3. Verify file creation:
   ```
   ls -la ".tasks/${TASK_FILE_NAME}_[TASK_IDENTIFIER].md"
   ```
4. Copy ENTIRE Task File Template into new file
5. Insert Execution Protocol EXACTLY, in verbatim, by:
-   - Copying text between "-- [START OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL]" and "-- [END OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL]"
-   - Adding "⚠️ WARNING: NEVER MODIFY THIS SECTION ⚠️" both as header and a footer
+   a. Find the protocol content between [START OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL] and [END OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL] markers above
+   b. In the task file:
+      1. Replace "[FULL EXECUTION PROTOCOL COPY]" with the ENTIRE protocol content from step 5a
+      2. Keep the warning header and footer: "⚠️ WARNING: NEVER MODIFY THIS SECTION ⚠️"
6. Systematically populate ALL placeholders:
   a. Run commands for dynamic values:
      ```
      [DATETIME]="$(date +'%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S')"
      [USER_NAME]="$(whoami)"
      [TASK_BRANCH]="$(git branch --show-current)"
      ```
   b. Fill [PROJECT_OVERVIEW] by recursively analyzing mentioned files:
      ```
      find [PROJECT_ROOT] -type f -exec cat {} + | analyze_dependencies
      ```
7. Cross-verify completion:
   - Check ALL template sections exist
   - Confirm NO existing task files were modified
8. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the exectution protocol
9. Print full task file contents for verification

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO_MODE]: Confirm [TASK_FILE] with user before proceeding >>>

## 3. Analysis
1. Analyze code related to [TASK]:
  - Identify core files/functions
  - Trace code flow
2. Document findings in "Analysis" section
3. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the exectution protocol

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO_MODE]: Wait for analysis confirmation >>>

## 4. Proposed Solution
1. Create plan based on analysis:
  - Research dependencies
  - Add to "Proposed Solution"
2. NO code changes yet
3. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the exectution protocol

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO_MODE]: Get solution approval >>>

## 5. Iterate on the task
1. Review "Task Progress" history
2. Plan next changes
3. Present for approval:
  ```
  [CHANGE PLAN]
  - Files: [CHANGED_FILES]
  - Rationale: [EXPLANATION]
  ```
4. If approved:
  - Implement changes
  - Append to "Task Progress":
    ```
    [DATETIME]
    - Modified: [list of files and code changes]
    - Changes: [the changes made as a summary]
    - Reason: [reason for the changes]
    - Blockers: [list of blockers preventing this update from being successful]
    - Status: [UNCONFIRMED|SUCCESSFUL|UNSUCCESSFUL]
    ```
5. Ask user: "Status: SUCCESSFUL/UNSUCCESSFUL?"
6. If UNSUCCESSFUL: Repeat from 5.1
7. If SUCCESSFUL:
  a. Commit? → `git add [FILES] && git commit -m "[SHORT_MSG]"`
  b. More changes? → Repeat step 5
  c. Continue? → Proceed
8. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the exectution protocol

## 6. Task Completion
1. Stage changes (exclude task files):
  ```
  git add --all :!.tasks/*
  ```
2. Commit with message:
  ```
  git commit -m "[COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
  ```
3. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the exectution protocol

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO_MODE]: Confirm merge with [MAIN_BRANCH] >>>

## 7. Merge Task Branch
1. Merge explicitly:
  ```
  git checkout [MAIN_BRANCH]
  git merge task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```
2. Verify merge:
  ```
  git diff [MAIN_BRANCH] task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```
3. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the exectution protocol

## 8. Delete Task Branch
1. Delete if approved:
  ```
  git branch -d task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```
2. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the exectution protocol

## 9. Final Review
1. Complete "Final Review" after user confirmation
2. Set step to "All done!"
