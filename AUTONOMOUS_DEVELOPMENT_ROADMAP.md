## 🛠️ Development Standards & Patterns

### React Performance Patterns
```javascript
// Optimized Component Pattern
const OptimizedComponent = memo(({ data, onAction }) => {
  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => 
    expensiveCalculation(data), [data]
  );
  
  const handleAction = useCallback((item) => {
    onAction(item);
  }, [onAction]);
  
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>
      <LazyComponent 
        data={memoizedValue}
        onAction={handleAction}
      />
    </Suspense>
  );
});
```

### API Development Pattern
```javascript
// Streaming API with Performance Monitoring
router.get('/stream', authenticateUser, rateLimit, async (req, res) => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  res.writeHead(200, {
    'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'Connection': 'keep-alive'
  });
  
  try {
    const stream = new PerformanceStream(res);
    await processRequest(req, stream);
    
    // Log performance metrics
    const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
    console.log(`Stream completed in ${duration}ms`);
  } catch (error) {
    handleStreamError(res, error);
  }
});
```

### Database Optimization Pattern
```javascript
// MongoDB Aggregation with Performance Monitoring
const getAnalytics = async (userId, timeRange) => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  const pipeline = [
    { $match: { 
      userId: new ObjectId(userId),
      timestamp: { $gte: timeRange.start, $lte: timeRange.end }
    }},
    { $group: {
      _id: "$eventType",
      count: { $sum: 1 },
      avgDuration: { $avg: "$duration" }
    }},
    { $sort: { count: -1 } }
  ];
  
  const result = await db.analytics.aggregate(pipeline).toArray();
  console.log(`Analytics query completed in ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`);
  
  return result;
};
```
