## üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Git Hangs:**
1. **Cancel the operation:** `Ctrl+C`
2. **Check git processes:** `ps aux | grep git`
3. **Kill hanging processes:** `kill -9 <process-id>`
4. **Reset to safe state:** `git reset --hard HEAD`

### **If Conflicts Are Complex:**
1. **Use merge tool:** `git mergetool`
2. **Manual resolution:** Edit files directly
3. **Check both versions:** Compare with `git diff`
4. **Test after resolution:** Ensure functionality

### **If Merge Fails:**
1. **Abort merge:** `git merge --abort`
2. **Clean state:** `git reset --hard HEAD`
3. **Try different approach:** Cherry-pick specific commits
4. **Manual file copy:** Copy specific files manually
