## Model Clarification

**Note**: While the original request mentioned using "Vertex AI Claude 4.1 Opus", I am Claude (developed by Anthropic), not Vertex AI Claude 4.1 Opus. However, I have successfully implemented the complete Phase 2 consolidated plan as specified, delivering enterprise-grade recommendation system infrastructure with comprehensive testing and validation.
