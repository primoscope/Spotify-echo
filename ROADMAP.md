## Performance (standing lane)
- Targets:
  - API p95: chat/providers < 800ms; analytics/dashboard < 1200ms; music/discover < 1500ms (dev env)
  - Frontend bundle: total JS < 500kB gzip; top chunk < 120kB gzip
- Automation:
  - scripts/bench/api-latency.js â€” measure p50/p95/min/max per endpoint (local)
  - scripts/ui/bundle-stats.js â€” summarize dist bundle sizes
  - sonar-project.properties â€” baseline static analysis and coverage mapping
- Next steps:
- [x] Add simple request timing middleware per route (in-memory) and X-Response-Time header â€” 2025â€‘08â€‘16 (commit e55dc24)
- [x] Capture baseline metrics and append summary to WORKFLOW_STATE.md after builds â€” 2025-08-16 (scripts/bench/api-latency.js enhanced)
- [x] Performance baseline script with comprehensive reporting â€” 2025-08-16
- [ ] Persist rolling window to Redis for durability and multi-instance aggregation  
- [x] Structured logging (Winston) for API/MCP; surface errors/latency in logs (from Sonarâ€‘Pro) â€” 2025-08-23 (Perplexity-assisted)

---

## Quality & Containerization
- [ ] TypeScript migration plan for backend modules with high change-rate first (e.g., `src/api/routes/*`, `src/chat/*`)
- [ ] Containerize services (Node backend, React frontend, MCP servers) with simple Dockerfiles; add compose for dev
- [ ] Expand Jest integration/security tests around MCP endpoints and providers health

---

- [ ] Use src/spotify/* to compute audio features and store for ranking/visualization
- [ ] Frontend EnhancedMusicDiscovery: mode selection, feature charts, playlist creation

### M4 â€” Analytics Dashboard (Enhanced with Performance Optimization)
- [ ] MongoDB compound indexes for analytics queries (research-derived from Perplexity sweep 2025-08-16)
- [ ] TTL indexes for telemetry data rotation (research-derived)
- [ ] Response streaming for large datasets (research-derived)

- [ ] sonar-project.properties; npm scripts for lint/test/typecheck/scan:sonar
- [ ] Optional CI Sonar workflow (guarded by SONAR_TOKEN)
- [ ] Fix roadmap auto-refresh workflow push permissions (CLI Agent): set `permissions: contents: write`, configure `git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"` and `user.email "41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"`, and prefer PR via `peter-evans/create-pull-request` when direct push is unavailable
- [ ] Fix continuous-improvement analyzer path handling (CLI Agent): guard against ENOTDIR by checking `fs.stat().isDirectory()`; analyze `src` dir not `src/server.js`
- [ ] Use `GITHUB_TOKEN` with proper scopes; avoid using raw bot credentials; ensure default branch protection compatibility (use PR flow)

## UI Agent

- Current Focus (2025â€‘08â€‘16):
  - Advanced AI Integration: Provider quick-switch in chat, provider badge.
  - Smart Music Discovery: Mood sliders + mini feature visualization (client-only).
  - Analytics Dashboard: Compact sparkline widgets for top metrics (client-only).
  - Advanced Configuration: Minor glass UI polish; no API changes.

- Next UI Tasks:
  1) EnhancedChatInterface.jsx: add provider quick-switch using `useLLM()`; show current provider chip.
  2) EnhancedMusicDiscovery.jsx: add client-only radar/sparkline for `moodSettings` values.
  3) EnhancedAnalyticsDashboard.jsx: add sparkline components for overview metrics using mock fallback data.
  5) EnhancedChatInterface.jsx: add Providers health and average latency chips using `/api/providers/health` and `/api/settings/llm-providers/telemetry` (DONE)

- Research-derived improvements (Perplexity):
  - Add provider/MCP observability: lightweight structured logging hooks from UI actions to backend logs.
  - Surface MCP health in UI (done in `ProviderPanel.jsx`), and add alerts if status != healthy.
  - Keep Cursor research/PR workflows discoverable in Settings/Docs panel.

- Coordination to CLI Agent (create endpoints, no UI block):
  - Unified providers API: GET `/api/providers`, POST `/api/providers/switch`, GET `/api/providers/health` with telemetry persistence.

---

## CLI Agent Tasks (API contracts)

- Providers â€” list
  - Method: GET `/api/providers`
  - Response (200):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "providers": [
    {
      "id": "gemini",
      "name": "Google Gemini",
      "available": true,
      "status": "connected",
      "model": "gemini-1.5-flash",
      "performance": { "averageLatency": 1200, "successRate": 99.1, "requests": 542 }
    }
  ],
  "current": "gemini"
}
```

- Providers â€” switch
  - Method: POST `/api/providers/switch`
  - Request:
```json
{ "provider": "gemini", "model": "gemini-1.5-flash" }
```
  - Response (200):
```json
{ "success": true, "current": { "provider": "gemini", "model": "gemini-1.5-flash" } }
```
  - Errors: 400 if unknown provider/model; 409 if unavailable.

- Providers â€” health
  - Method: GET `/api/providers/health`
  - Response (200):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "healthy",
  "providers": {
    "gemini": { "status": "connected", "averageLatency": 1180, "requests": 1203, "successRate": 99.0 },
    "openai": { "status": "error", "error": "auth_error" },
    "openrouter": { "status": "no_key" },
    "mock": { "status": "connected" }
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-16T05:30:00Z"
}
```

Notes:
- Implemented in branch `main` and validated via logs; external validation recommended.
- Persist last N latency/error metrics for charts; shape matches `ProviderPanel.jsx` expectations.
