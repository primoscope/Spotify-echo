## UI Agent

- Current Focus (2025‑08‑16):
  - Advanced AI Integration: Provider quick-switch in chat, provider badge.
  - Smart Music Discovery: Mood sliders + mini feature visualization (client-only).
  - Analytics Dashboard: Compact sparkline widgets for top metrics (client-only).
  - Advanced Configuration: Minor glass UI polish; no API changes.

- Next UI Tasks:
  1) EnhancedChatInterface.jsx: add provider quick-switch using `useLLM()`; show current provider chip.
  2) EnhancedMusicDiscovery.jsx: add client-only radar/sparkline for `moodSettings` values.
  3) EnhancedAnalyticsDashboard.jsx: add sparkline components for overview metrics using mock fallback data.
  5) EnhancedChatInterface.jsx: add Providers health and average latency chips using `/api/providers/health` and `/api/settings/llm-providers/telemetry` (DONE)

- Research-derived improvements (Perplexity):
  - Add provider/MCP observability: lightweight structured logging hooks from UI actions to backend logs.
  - Surface MCP health in UI (done in `ProviderPanel.jsx`), and add alerts if status != healthy.
  - Keep Cursor research/PR workflows discoverable in Settings/Docs panel.

- Coordination to CLI Agent (create endpoints, no UI block):
  - Unified providers API: GET `/api/providers`, POST `/api/providers/switch`, GET `/api/providers/health` with telemetry persistence.

- **Contextual & Mood-Based Discovery** is now a top priority, as context-based listening (activity, mood, time) is overtaking traditional genre/artist-based discovery[1][3].
- **Personalization Depth**: Move beyond collaborative filtering to include *user-uploaded data* and *real-time context signals* for recommendations[1][5].
- **Creator Tools**: AI as a creative partner is now expected, not optional—integrate tools that assist but do not replace human creativity[4].

#### 🚀 Implementation Suggestions for Emerging Technologies

- **Personal Model Training**:  
  - Use open-source frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow.js, PyTorch) to allow in-browser or cloud-based training of lightweight user models[5].
