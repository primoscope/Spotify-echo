Generated: 2025-08-16T03:53:17.276Z

## How to use this document
- This roadmap is auto-updated using Perplexity Sonar‑Pro and Grok‑4.
- For browser research inside Cursor, run the workflow: `.cursor/workflows/perplexity-browser-research.json`.
- For PR reviews, use `.cursor/workflows/pr-deep-dive.json`.

## Executive Summary (Sonar‑Pro)

EchoTune AI should prioritize the following roadmap steps, focusing on Perplexity integration, CI, Cursor workflows, and security, given your current state (main branch stable, Perplexity endpoint live, CI caches/canary, Cursor workflows ready):

**1. Finalize and Harden Perplexity Integration**
- Validate the live Perplexity endpoint with production-level queries and edge cases to ensure reliability and relevance of responses[1][3][5].
- Implement robust error handling and fallback logic for Perplexity API failures.
- Monitor and log Perplexity usage for analytics and debugging.

**2. Enhance CI/CD with Security and Observability**
- Expand CI canary tests to cover Perplexity integration scenarios, including authentication failures and rate limiting[3].
- Integrate security scanning (e.g., SAST/DAST) into CI to catch vulnerabilities early.
- Ensure secrets (API keys, tokens) are managed securely in CI pipelines (e.g., environment variables, vaults)[3].

**3. Optimize Cursor Workflows**
- Leverage Cursor’s new Perplexity integration to automate research and code review tasks directly within development workflows[2][4].
- Use Cursor’s task management to coordinate multi-agent development and automated code reviews, ensuring all Perplexity-powered features are covered[4].
- Document and share best practices for using Perplexity within Cursor to maximize developer productivity.

**4. Security Hardening and Compliance**
- Audit all Perplexity and Cursor integrations for least-privilege API access and proper authentication/authorization[3].
- Regularly review and rotate API keys; implement monitoring for suspicious access patterns.
- Ensure compliance with data privacy and retention policies for all third-party integrations.

**5. Continuous Feedback and Iteration**
- Collect feedback from users and developers on Perplexity-powered features and Cursor workflows.
- Iterate on integration points, CI coverage, and security posture based on real-world usage and incident reports.

This roadmap ensures EchoTune AI’s Perplexity integration is robust, secure, and fully leveraged within modern CI and Cursor-driven workflows, while maintaining a strong security and compliance foundation.

## Architectural Deep‑Dive (Grok‑4)

EchoTune AI’s architecture is modular, leveraging **Node.js**, **React**, **MCP servers**, **Redis**, and **MongoDB** to support AI-driven workflows, persistent context, and scalable integrations. The structure is robust but can be further strengthened for maintainability, scalability, and security.

**Key Architectural Assessment**

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  The codebase is organized into clear domains: API, authentication, backend, chat, components, database, middleware, ML, security, and utilities. This modularity aligns with best practices for maintainability and extensibility[2][5].

- **MCP Server Integration:**  
  The use of MCP servers (e.g., Perplexity, Filesystem, Brave Search) enables persistent, contextual AI interactions and tool orchestration. Each server appears to be encapsulated, supporting protocol-based communication and modular tool integration[1][2][5].

- **Frontend/Backend Decoupling:**  
  React (frontend) and Node.js (backend) are separated, facilitating independent development and deployment. Vite accelerates frontend builds.

- **Data Layer:**  
  MongoDB (for persistent storage) and Redis (for caching and fast access) are industry-standard choices, supporting both scalability and performance[1][4].

- **Testing & Automation:**  
  Jest is used for testing, and a rich set of scripts supports automation, validation, and CI/CD.

**Strengths**

- **Modular MCP Architecture:**  
  Each MCP server is isolated, supporting independent scaling and updates. The protocol-based approach enables flexible integration with AI models and external tools[1][2][5].

- **Security Awareness:**  
  Dedicated directories for authentication and security indicate a focus on best practices, though implementation details should be reviewed for hardcoded secrets, token management, and input validation[4].

- **Extensive Automation:**  
  The scripts directory covers advanced automation, data analysis, and validation, supporting robust development workflows.

**Areas for Improvement & Recommendations**

- **Adopt Clean Architecture Principles:**  
  Further enforce separation between business logic, protocol handling, and infrastructure. For MCP servers, ensure that communication handlers, tool modules, and integration points are strictly decoupled for easier maintenance and testing[1][2].

- **Type Safety & Validation:**  
  Use TypeScript across the backend (if not already) for type safety. Employ schema validation libraries (e.g., Zod) for all MCP request/response payloads to prevent malformed data and injection attacks[3][4].

- **Centralized Configuration & Secrets Management:**  
  Store all credentials and configuration in environment variables or a secrets manager. Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in the codebase[4].

- **Enhanced Logging & Monitoring:**  
  Integrate structured logging (e.g., Winston) and set up health checks, error monitoring, and alerting for all MCP servers and core services[4].

- **Performance Optimization:**  
  Implement caching (Redis) for frequently accessed data, connection pooling for databases, and rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and ensure responsiveness[4].

- **Testing Coverage:**  
  Expand Jest test coverage to include integration and end-to-end tests for MCP workflows, not just unit tests.

- **Documentation & Onboarding:**  
  Ensure that README files in each major directory (especially MCP servers and scripts) are up to date, with clear setup, usage, and extension instructions.

**Summary Table: Architectural Focus Areas**

| Area                       | Current State                        | Recommendations                                   |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Modularity                 | Strong, clear separation             | Enforce clean architecture, decouple further      |
| MCP Integration            | Multiple servers, protocol-based     | Use schema validation, expand tool modularity     |
| Security                   | Dedicated dirs, likely best practices| Centralize secrets, audit for vulnerabilities     |
| Data Layer                 | MongoDB, Redis                       | Optimize queries, add connection pooling          |
| Testing & Automation       | Jest, rich scripts                   | Expand to integration/E2E, automate more flows    |
| Observability              | Not specified                        | Add structured logging, monitoring, health checks |
| Documentation              | Present in key dirs                  | Keep updated, add onboarding and extension guides |

**Conclusion:**  
EchoTune AI’s architecture is well-structured and modern, but should further emphasize clean separation, type safety, security, and observability to ensure long-term scalability and reliability[1][2][3][4][5].
