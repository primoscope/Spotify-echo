# EchoTune AI — Auto-Refreshed Roadmap

Generated: 2025-08-16T03:40:36.396Z

## How to use this document
- This roadmap is auto-updated using Perplexity Sonar‑Pro and Grok‑4.
- For browser research inside Cursor, run the workflow: `.cursor/workflows/perplexity-browser-research.json`.
- For PR reviews, use `.cursor/workflows/pr-deep-dive.json`.

## Executive Summary (Sonar‑Pro)

EchoTune AI should prioritize the following roadmap to maximize value from Perplexity integration, CI, Cursor workflows, and security, given your current context:

**1. Perplexity Integration**
- **Stabilize and monitor the live Perplexity endpoint** to ensure consistent, real-time web search and synthesis capabilities for EchoTune AI[1][3][5].
- **Expand integration coverage** by leveraging the MCP server for seamless, up-to-date information retrieval across all AI-powered features[1].
- **Document integration patterns** for maintainability and onboarding.

**2. CI (Continuous Integration)**
- **Optimize CI caching and canary deployments** to minimize build times and catch regressions early.
- **Automate test coverage for Perplexity endpoint** to ensure reliability as new features are added.
- **Integrate security checks into CI** to catch vulnerabilities before deployment.

**3. Cursor Workflows**
- **Leverage Cursor’s Perplexity access** to automate research, code reviews, and documentation updates directly within development workflows[2][4].
- **Enable multi-agent parallel workflows** for faster development and review cycles[4].
- **Automate task tracking and completion** using Cursor’s built-in task management to streamline project management[4].

**4. Security**
- **Enforce API key management and rotation** for Perplexity and related integrations[3].
- **Audit authentication and authorization flows** for all endpoints, especially those exposed via Cursor or CI.
- **Regularly review and update dependency and infrastructure security** as part of the CI pipeline.

**Prioritization Table**

| Priority | Area                | Key Actions                                                                 |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Perplexity          | Stabilize endpoint, expand integration, document patterns                   |
| 2        | CI                  | Optimize caching/canary, automate tests, integrate security checks          |
| 3        | Cursor Workflows    | Automate research/code review, enable parallel agents, streamline tasks     |
| 4        | Security            | Enforce key management, audit auth flows, update dependencies               |

This roadmap ensures EchoTune AI remains robust, efficient, and secure as it scales across these core areas.

## Architectural Deep‑Dive (Grok‑4)

EchoTune AI’s architecture leverages a modern stack—**Node.js, React, Vite, Redis, MongoDB, and MCP servers**—with a modular directory structure supporting both AI-driven workflows and scalable web services. Below is a deep assessment and targeted recommendations:

**Strengths**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear division between frontend (React), backend (Node.js), and specialized domains (e.g., auth, chat, ml, security).
- **MCP Integration:** Use of MCP servers (Perplexity, Filesystem, Brave Search) enables persistent, contextual AI interactions and modular tool orchestration[1][3].
- **Scalability Foundations:** Redis for caching and MongoDB for persistence support high throughput and flexible data models.
- **Testing & Automation:** Presence of Jest and comprehensive scripts for validation, automation, and CI/CD.
- **Prompt Catalog:** Centralized prompt management for AI workflows, supporting research and architectural decision records (ADR).

**Architectural Recommendations**

**1. Enforce Clean Architecture & SOLID Principles**
- Refactor backend modules (e.g., api, auth, ml, chat) to strictly separate business logic, data access, and presentation layers[1].
- Use dependency injection for easier testing and future extensibility.

**2. Containerization & DevOps**
- Package all MCP servers and core services as Docker containers for consistent deployment and scaling[2][4].
- Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes for orchestration, especially as the number of MCP servers grows.

**3. Microservices Evolution**
- Consider splitting monolithic backend logic into microservices (e.g., authentication, chat, ML inference, analytics) to enable independent scaling and deployment[4].
- Each microservice should have its own database or schema to avoid tight coupling.

**4. Type Safety & Validation**
- Adopt TypeScript across Node.js services for type safety and maintainability[3].
- Use schema validation libraries (e.g., Zod) for all API and MCP server inputs to prevent runtime errors and improve security[3].

**5. Advanced Logging & Monitoring**
- Integrate structured logging (e.g., Winston) and distributed tracing to monitor MCP interactions and backend workflows[3].
- Set up alerting for key metrics (latency, error rates, resource usage).

**6. Security Hardening**
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities, especially in AI and MCP-related packages[2].
- Isolate sensitive services (e.g., auth, security) and enforce strict API gateway or middleware validation.
- Store secrets and credentials using environment variables or a secrets manager.

**7. Frontend Optimization**
- Consider server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) with frameworks like Next.js for improved SEO and faster load times[4].
- Modularize React components and use state management best practices for maintainability.

**8. Documentation & Standards**
- Maintain up-to-date documentation for all MCP servers, APIs, and scripts.
- Adopt and enforce coding standards, possibly integrating a coding standards MCP server for automated checks[5].

**Key Next Steps**
- Audit current codebase for architectural drift and refactor toward clean, modular boundaries.
- Containerize all major services and MCP servers.
- Incrementally migrate to microservices where justified by scaling or domain complexity.
- Implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and security practices.

This approach will enhance maintainability, scalability, and security, positioning EchoTune AI for robust growth and reliable AI-driven workflows.
