# EchoTune AI — Auto-Refreshed Roadmap

Generated: 2025-08-16T03:59:19.674Z

## How to use this document
- This roadmap is auto-updated using Perplexity Sonar‑Pro and Grok‑4.
- For browser research inside Cursor, run the workflow: `.cursor/workflows/perplexity-browser-research.json`.
- For PR reviews, use `.cursor/workflows/pr-deep-dive.json`.

## Executive Summary (Sonar‑Pro)

EchoTune AI should prioritize the following roadmap steps to maximize Perplexity integration, CI reliability, Cursor workflows, and security:

**1. Perplexity Integration**
- Ensure **endpoint stability and monitoring** for the live Perplexity API connection[5].
- Implement **MCP server integration** for real-time, web-wide research via Sonar API, following open standards for seamless AI tool connectivity[3].
- Set up **API key management** and secure environment variables for both Perplexity and any observability platforms (e.g., Helicone)[5].

**2. CI (Continuous Integration)**
- Maintain and optimize **CI caching** to speed up builds and reduce redundant work.
- Expand **canary deployments** for early detection of integration issues with Perplexity endpoints.
- Automate **test coverage** for Perplexity-related features to ensure reliability after each commit.

**3. Cursor Workflows**
- Leverage **Cursor’s automation capabilities** to run Perplexity-powered agents for code search, documentation retrieval, and workflow orchestration[2][4].
- Use **task lists within Cursor** to drive implementation phases and automate code reviews for Perplexity-integrated features[4].
- Enable **parallel development** (front-end/back-end) with Cursor agents, followed by integration and validation steps[4].

**4. Security**
- Enforce **API key rotation** and restrict access to sensitive credentials.
- Audit **authentication headers** and ensure all requests to Perplexity endpoints use secure tokens[5].
- Regularly review **access logs** and monitor for unauthorized usage or anomalies.

**Prioritization Table**

| Priority | Area                | Key Actions                                                      |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Perplexity Integration | Endpoint stability, MCP server setup, API key management         |
| 2        | CI                  | Caching, canary deployments, automated testing                   |
| 3        | Cursor Workflows    | Agent automation, task-driven phases, code review automation     |
| 4        | Security            | Key rotation, secure headers, access monitoring                  |

Focus first on robust Perplexity integration and endpoint reliability, then reinforce CI and automation, streamline Cursor workflows, and continually strengthen security controls.

## Architectural Deep‑Dive (Grok‑4)

EchoTune AI’s architecture leverages **Node.js, React, MCP servers, Vite, Jest, Redis, and MongoDB**, with a modular directory structure supporting both AI workflows and scalable web features. Below is a deep assessment and targeted recommendations for improvement.

---

**Architectural Assessment**

- **Modularity & Separation of Concerns**
  - The `src` directory is well-organized, separating API, auth, backend, chat, components, database, middleware, ML, mobile, security, and utility logic.
  - MCP servers are isolated in their own directory, supporting extensibility and independent development[1][3].

- **MCP Integration**
  - MCP servers (e.g., Perplexity, brave-search) are implemented as independent services, enabling persistent, contextual AI interactions beyond simple API calls[1][3].
  - Workflows and prompt catalogs facilitate advanced research and ADR (Architecture Decision Record) automation.

- **Tech Stack**
  - **Node.js** powers backend and MCP servers, with **React** for frontend.
  - **Redis** is likely used for caching/session management, and **MongoDB** for persistent storage.
  - **Vite** enables fast frontend builds; **Jest** supports robust testing.

- **Automation & Scripts**
  - Extensive automation scripts in `/scripts` for data analysis, validation, CI, and integration testing indicate mature DevOps practices.

- **Security & Best Practices**
  - Security modules exist, but best practices (e.g., secrets management, request validation, token rotation) should be verified for MCP and API endpoints[4].

- **Scalability**
  - Microservices pattern is suggested by the separation of MCP servers and backend modules, supporting independent scaling and deployment[5].

---

**Recommendations**

- **Adopt Clean Architecture for MCP Servers**
  - Ensure MCP servers follow SOLID principles and clean separation between transport, business logic, and data access layers[1].
  - Use schemas (e.g., Zod) for strict request validation[3].

- **Containerization & Orchestration**
  - Package MCP servers and core services as Docker containers for consistent deployment and scalability[2][5].
  - Consider Kubernetes for orchestrating containers in production.

- **Security Enhancements**
  - Store secrets in environment variables or a secrets manager; never hardcode credentials[4].
  - Implement request validation and error handling for all API/MCP endpoints.
  - Add rate limiting and timeout handling to prevent abuse and ensure reliability[4].

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data and connection pooling for MongoDB/API calls[4].
  - Optimize response payloads by filtering unnecessary fields.

- **Monitoring & Logging**
  - Integrate structured logging (e.g., Winston) and health checks for all services[4].
  - Set up monitoring and alerting for error rates, response times, and critical failures.

- **Testing & CI/CD**
  - Expand Jest test coverage for both backend and MCP workflows.
  - Automate integration and end-to-end tests for MCP workflows in CI pipelines.

- **Frontend Improvements**
  - Consider server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) for React (using Next.js) to improve performance and SEO[5].

- **Documentation & ADRs**
  - Maintain up-to-date documentation for MCP workflows, API contracts, and architectural decisions (ADRs).
  - Use the prompt catalog to standardize research and decision-making templates.
