Generated: 2025-08-16T05:23:34.535Z

## How to use this document
- This roadmap is auto-updated using Perplexity Sonar‑Pro and Grok‑4.
- For browser research inside Cursor, run the workflow: `.cursor/workflows/perplexity-browser-research.json`.
- For PR reviews, use `.cursor/workflows/pr-deep-dive.json`.

## Executive Summary (Sonar‑Pro)

EchoTune AI should prioritize the following roadmap, focusing on seamless Perplexity integration, robust CI, efficient Cursor workflows, and security:

**1. Perplexity Integration**
- Finalize and document the MCP server integration with Perplexity’s Sonar API for real-time, web-wide research capabilities[1].
- Ensure API keys and authentication headers are securely managed and environment variables are set (e.g., `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`)[3].
- Validate live endpoint functionality and monitor for reliability.

**2. CI (Continuous Integration)**
- Maintain and optimize CI caching and canary deployments to ensure rapid feedback and safe rollouts.
- Automate tests for Perplexity endpoint and integration points to catch regressions early.
- Regularly review and update CI workflows for new features or security patches.

**3. Cursor Workflows**
- Leverage Cursor’s Perplexity integration to automate research, code review, and task management directly within the development environment[2][4].
- Use Cursor’s task lists to drive multi-agent workflows and parallelize development tasks for efficiency[4].
- Integrate Perplexity-powered search into Cursor for up-to-date documentation and code insights[2].

**4. Security**
- Audit all API key usage and storage, ensuring secrets are never exposed in logs or code repositories[3].
- Implement role-based access controls for both Perplexity and internal endpoints.
- Regularly review dependency and workflow security, especially around CI and Cursor integrations.

**Prioritization Table**

| Priority | Area                | Key Actions                                                                 |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Perplexity Integration | Secure, document, and monitor live endpoint; manage API keys[1][3]         |
| 2        | CI                  | Optimize caching/canary, automate integration tests, update workflows       |
| 3        | Cursor Workflows    | Automate research/code review, use task lists, integrate Perplexity search[2][4] |
| 4        | Security            | Audit secrets, enforce access controls, review dependencies                 |

This roadmap ensures EchoTune AI remains robust, efficient, and secure as it scales across Perplexity, CI, and Cursor environments.

## Architectural Deep‑Dive (Grok‑4)

EchoTune AI’s architecture leverages **Node.js, React, MCP servers, Vite, Jest, Redis, and MongoDB**, organized into modular directories for API, authentication, backend, chat, components, and more. The use of MCP servers (notably Perplexity and Brave Search) enables persistent, contextual AI interactions and workflow orchestration. Below is a deep assessment and targeted recommendations:

---

**Architectural Assessment**

- **Modularity & Separation of Concerns**
  - The directory structure (e.g., `api`, `auth`, `backend`, `chat`, `components`, `mcp`, `ml`, `security`, etc.) reflects strong modularity, supporting maintainability and scalability[3].
  - MCP servers are separated into their own directory, with clear integration points for analytics, search, browser automation, and validation workflows[3].

- **MCP Server Implementation**
  - MCP servers are central for AI tool orchestration, using protocol handlers and request schemas for robust communication[1][3].
  - Integration points (HTTP, WebSockets, STDIO) are likely present, enabling flexible client connections and real-time data exchange[3][1].
  - Use of schemas (e.g., `CallToolRequestSchema`, `ListToolsRequestSchema`) ensures request validation and protocol compliance[1].

- **Tech Stack Choices**
  - **Node.js**: Efficient for asynchronous operations and scalable server-side logic[4][5].
  - **React + Vite**: Modern, fast frontend development.
  - **Redis**: Likely used for caching and session management, improving performance[5].
  - **MongoDB**: Flexible NoSQL storage for user data, chat logs, and AI context.
  - **Jest**: Supports robust testing practices.

- **Security & Best Practices**
  - Dedicated `security` and `auth` modules suggest attention to authentication and authorization.
  - Use of environment variables and secrets management is recommended to avoid credential leaks[5].
  - Request validation and error handling are critical for MCP endpoints[5].

- **Automation & Scripts**
  - Extensive scripts for data analysis, automation, validation, and integration testing indicate mature DevOps and data engineering practices.

- **Prompt Catalog & Templates**
  - Centralized prompt management enables consistent AI interactions and research workflows.

---

**Recommendations**

- **Enforce Clean Architecture Principles**
  - Further decouple business logic from protocol handlers and integration points to simplify future extensions and maintenance[1][3].
  - Adopt SOLID principles across MCP server modules for robustness[1].

- **Type Safety & Validation**
  - Use TypeScript throughout Node.js codebase for type safety and maintainability[4].
  - Employ schema validation libraries (e.g., Zod) for all MCP request/response payloads[4].

- **Containerization & Deployment**
  - Package MCP servers and core services as Docker containers for reproducible, scalable deployment[2][5].
  - Implement health checks and structured logging for production readiness[5].

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data and session management[5].
  - Optimize MongoDB queries and consider connection pooling for high-throughput scenarios[5].
  - Implement rate limiting and timeout handling on MCP endpoints to prevent abuse and ensure reliability[5].

- **Security Hardening**
  - Never hardcode credentials; use environment variables and secrets management[5].
  - Regularly audit authentication flows and validate all incoming requests to MCP servers[5].
  - Consider token rotation and robust error handling for long-running services[5].

- **Monitoring & Observability**
  - Integrate structured logging (e.g., Winston) and monitoring for MCP servers and backend services[4][5].
  - Set up alerting for critical failures and implement tracing for complex workflows[5].

- **Testing & Validation**
  - Expand Jest test coverage for MCP server modules, API endpoints, and integration workflows.
  - Automate comprehensive validation of MCP protocol compliance and data integrity.

| Area                | Assessment                                    | Recommendation                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Modularity          | Strong separation of concerns                  | Further decouple protocol handlers & business logic |
| MCP Implementation  | Protocol-driven, schema-validated              | Use TypeScript & Zod for type safety/validation  |
| Performance         | Redis/MongoDB for caching & storage            | Optimize queries, use connection pooling         |
| Security            | Dedicated modules, likely env vars             | Audit flows, never hardcode secrets, validate requests |
| Deployment          | Scripts for automation, likely CI/CD           | Containerize with Docker, add health checks      |
| Monitoring          | Some logging, unclear on observability         | Use Winston, set up monitoring & alerting        |
| Testing             | Jest present, many validation scripts          | Expand coverage, automate protocol compliance    |
