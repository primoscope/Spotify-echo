# Continuous Coding Agent - Demo

This file demonstrates how the continuous coding agent workflow operates. When this file is committed and the workflow runs, it will:

## Trigger Workflow
The GitHub workflow (`.github/workflows/continuous-agent.yml`) will automatically trigger because this file is in the `agent-workflow/` directory.

## Expected Behavior
1. **Analysis Phase**: The agent will analyze recent commits and changes
2. **Task Generation**: New development tasks will be created based on the analysis
3. **Prompt Creation**: Detailed prompts for coding agents will be generated
4. **GitHub Integration**: If GH_PAT is configured, a new GitHub issue will be created
5. **Progress Update**: The README will be updated with current development status

## Generated Output Files
The workflow will create:
- `agent-workflow/summaries/analysis-[timestamp].json` - Analysis results
- `agent-workflow/tasks/tasks-[timestamp].json` - Generated tasks
- `agent-workflow/prompts/prompt-[timestamp].json` - Coding agent prompts
- `agent-workflow/progress/cycle-[n].json` - Progress tracking

## Current Cycle Status
This is demonstration of the continuous coding agent system for the Spotify-echo repository. The system is designed to:

- Automatically continue development after each PR merge
- Generate intelligent tasks based on code analysis
- Create coding agent prompts for automated development
- Track progress and update documentation
- Maintain continuous improvement momentum

## Integration with Existing Systems
The continuous agent integrates with:
- ✅ Existing GitHub Actions workflows
- ✅ Prompt orchestrator system
- ✅ MCP server infrastructure
- ✅ Development automation tools
- ✅ README progress tracking

## Demo Complete
This file serves as a demonstration of the trigger mechanism. In a real scenario, the workflow would analyze actual PR merges and generate tasks based on recent development activity.
