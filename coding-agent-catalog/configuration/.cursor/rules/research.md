# Research-Driven Development Rules

## When to Use @perplexity Research
- **New Feature Planning**: Research latest music tech trends
- **Bug Investigation**: Search for similar issues and solutions
- **Performance Optimization**: Find best practices and benchmarks
- **Library Selection**: Compare alternatives and recent reviews
- **Security Updates**: Check for vulnerabilities and patches

## Research Query Patterns
- **Music Tech**: "latest developments in [topic] music technology 2024"
- **Performance**: "[framework] performance optimization techniques 2024"
- **Security**: "[library] security vulnerabilities recent fixes"
- **Best Practices**: "[technology] best practices enterprise production"

## Research Integration Workflow
1. **Query**: Use specific, recent-focused research queries
2. **Analyze**: Review sources and credibility
3. **Plan**: Create implementation roadmap with citations
4. **Implement**: Apply findings with proper attribution
5. **Validate**: Test against research benchmarks

## Citation Requirements
- **Source Tracking**: Include research sources in code comments
- **Documentation**: Add research links to technical decisions
- **Performance**: Benchmark against research claims
- **Updates**: Re-research every 3-6 months for fast-changing areas
