### Configuration
- âœ… .cursor/perplexity-enhanced-config.json - Enhanced Cursor IDE configuration
- âœ… AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT_SYSTEM.md - Comprehensive documentation

### Triggers & Integration
- âœ… Comment triggers: `@copilot use perplexity browser research`
- âœ… Slash commands: `/start-autonomous-development`
- âœ… Scheduled triggers: Daily research at 2 AM UTC
- âœ… GitHub Copilot integration enhanced

### Session Management
- âœ… Session directory structure created
- âœ… Artifact management configured
- âœ… Progress tracking implemented

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Use

The autonomous development system is fully validated and ready for use:

1. **Comment Trigger**: `@copilot use perplexity browser research`
2. **Slash Command**: `/start-autonomous-development`
3. **Automatic**: Daily research and continuous monitoring

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

1. Set up required secrets (PERPLEXITY_API_KEY, BROWSERBASE_API_KEY)
2. Configure environment variables as needed
3. Test with initial comment trigger
4. Monitor first autonomous development cycle
5. Review session reports and optimize as needed
