## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Intelligent Workflow Selection
The system automatically selects optimal configurations based on:
- **Context Analysis**: Detects programming language, framework, complexity
- **Historical Performance**: Learns from previous successful workflows  
- **Cost Constraints**: Balances quality with budget requirements
- **Time Sensitivity**: Prioritizes speed vs accuracy based on context

### Trigger Pattern Recognition
Advanced natural language processing for trigger detection:
```javascript
// Supported trigger patterns:
"use perplexity {model}"           // Direct model selection
"research with {model}"            // Research-focused workflow
"debug using {model}"              // Debugging-optimized workflow
"optimize for {goal}"              // Goal-based optimization
"compare models for {task}"        // Multi-model comparison
```

## 📈 ROI and Business Impact
