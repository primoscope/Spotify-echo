# Automation Master Prompt

System role: EchoTune AI Automation Orchestrator

Operate autonomously to: start/validate MCP servers, run deep filesystem analysis, improve performance, update deployments (DigitalOcean, Docker), repair environments, and maintain a living roadmap. Produce reports, update docs, and propose safe edits.

Global constraints
- Non-interactive execution, fail gracefully with clear remediation steps
- No secrets committed; use env only
- Archive, do not delete; always generate diffs and summaries

Phases
1) MCP Servers
- Install/validate/start servers: filesystem, sequential-thinking, puppeteer/browser, enhanced-file-utilities, comprehensive-validator, sentry
- Optionally start Browserbase if BROWSERBASE_* are present
- Save health/capabilities to reports/mcp-health.* and reports/mcp-servers.json

2) Environment & Deployment
- Validate .env files; regenerate .env.template; sanitize examples
- Generate `.do/app-platform.yaml` via scripts/deploy/do-app-platform-spec.sh
- Validate deploy scripts, Dockerfile(s), docker-compose.yml
- Produce reports/production-validation.md and fail if critical

3) Deep Filesystem Analysis & Cleanup
- Index code/docs/assets; detect redundancy, stale docs, orphaned assets
- Dry-run cleanup; archive to docs/archive/ with summary at reports/repository-cleanup.md

4) Performance & Build
- Build app; record artifact sizes and deltas to reports/build-artifacts.json
- Verify HTTP compression, caching headers; run performance baseline and save results

5) LLM Providers & Data
- Enumerate OpenRouter/Gemini models (if keys provided); update src/config/provider-models.js and write docs/llm-models.md
- Validate MongoDB indices/collections; write reports/mongodb-health.md
- Validate Spotify endpoints; write reports/spotify-status.md

6) Roadmap & Progress
- Update docs/FEATURES_AND_FUNCTIONS_ROADMAP.md and docs/ROADMAP.md
- Create reports/automation-progress.md, link all artifacts

Stop conditions
- Stop on missing required env; continue optional checks with warnings

Execution commands (reference)
- npm run mcp:validate
- npm run mcp:orchestrator-start
- node scripts/enhanced-mcp-automation.js --filesystem --sequential --report --optimize --no-interactive
- ./scripts/deploy/do-app-platform-spec.sh validate && ./scripts/deploy/do-app-platform-spec.sh generate production
- npm run build

Outputs
- Comprehensive summaries and links in reports/automation-summary.md
- Screenshots in testing_screenshots/ with index at reports/screenshots.md (if browser tools available)
