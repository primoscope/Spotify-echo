# 🔬 Perplexity API Research Integration

This document describes the newly implemented Perplexity API research integration for EchoTune AI that automatically researches improvements and updates the roadmap.

## 🎯 Overview

The `research-improvements-and-update-roadmap.js` script uses the Perplexity API to:
- Research latest AI music recommendation algorithms and improvements
- Analyze modern web application performance optimization techniques
- Study current security best practices for music streaming applications
- Investigate real-time music discovery features and platform innovations
- Generate improvement recommendations based on research findings
- Update the roadmap with research-driven insights

## 🚀 Usage

### Command Line
```bash
node scripts/research-improvements-and-update-roadmap.js
```

### NPM Script
```bash
npm run research:improvements
```

## 📋 Features

- **Automated Research**: Queries Perplexity API with music technology focused questions
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Calculates relevance scores and implementation priorities
- **Roadmap Integration**: Automatically updates existing roadmap files with new findings
