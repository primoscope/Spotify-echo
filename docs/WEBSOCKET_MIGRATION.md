# WebSocket Migration Notes for Vercel Deployment

## Current WebSocket Usage
The application currently includes Socket.io integration in `src/server.js` for real-time features.

## Vercel Serverless Limitations
⚠️ **Important**: Vercel serverless functions do not support persistent WebSocket connections.

## Migration Strategies

### Option 1: External WebSocket Provider (Recommended)
Replace Socket.io with a managed service:
- **Ably** - Real-time messaging platform
- **Pusher** - WebSocket as a service  
- **Socket.io with Redis Adapter** - Use external Redis for scaling

### Option 2: Separate Long-Running Service
Deploy WebSocket functionality separately:
- **Railway** - Simple deployment for Node.js services
- **Render** - WebSocket support in standard plans
- **DigitalOcean App Platform** - Full WebSocket support
- **Fly.io** - Edge deployment with WebSocket persistence

### Option 3: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
Replace WebSockets with HTTP-based real-time updates:
- Supported by Vercel serverless functions
- Good for one-way server-to-client updates
- Less complex than WebSocket alternatives

### Option 4: HTTP Polling
For less frequent updates:
- Standard HTTP requests to `/api/status` or `/api/metrics`
- Graceful degradation strategy
- Works with existing API endpoints

## Implementation Recommendation
For immediate Vercel deployment:
1. WebSocket features gracefully degrade to HTTP polling
2. Real-time features continue to work but with reduced frequency
3. Consider Option 1 or 2 for production real-time requirements

## Code Changes Required
No immediate changes needed - application handles WebSocket unavailability gracefully.
For production, implement one of the above strategies based on real-time requirements.
