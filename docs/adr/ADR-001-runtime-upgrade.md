# EchoTune AI - Architecture Decision Record 001
# Runtime Upgrade to Node.js 20 LTS

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-08-25  
**Authors:** EchoTune AI Development Team  

## Context

EchoTune AI currently operates on various Node.js versions across different environments. To ensure optimal performance, security, and access to latest features for our music recommendation platform, we need to standardize on a modern, stable Node.js runtime.

## Decision

We will upgrade to **Node.js 20 LTS** as our standard runtime across all environments (development, staging, production).

## Rationale

### Performance Benefits
- **V8 Engine Improvements**: Node.js 20 includes V8 11.3 with significant performance optimizations
- **HTTP/2 Performance**: Enhanced HTTP/2 implementation crucial for Spotify API integration
- **Module Loading**: Faster ES Module loading improves application startup time
- **Memory Management**: Better garbage collection for long-running recommendation engine processes

### Security Enhancements
- **Updated OpenSSL**: Latest security patches for HTTPS connections to Spotify and AI APIs
- **Security Policies**: Built-in security policies for dependency management
- **Audit Tools**: Enhanced `npm audit` integration for vulnerability detection

### Feature Compatibility
- **Native Test Runner**: Built-in test runner reduces dependency on external testing frameworks
- **Fetch API**: Native fetch eliminates need for additional HTTP client libraries
- **Watch Mode**: Built-in file watching for development efficiency
- **ES2023 Features**: Support for latest JavaScript features used in AI/ML libraries

### Ecosystem Alignment
- **Spotify SDK**: Latest Spotify Web SDK requires Node.js 18+
- **AI Libraries**: TensorFlow.js and other ML libraries optimize for Node.js 20
- **MCP Protocol**: Model Context Protocol implementations target Node.js 20+

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Development Environment (Week 1)
- Update `package.json` engines field to `"node": "20.x"`
- Update Dockerfile to use `node:20-alpine`
- Update GitHub Actions workflows to use Node.js 20
- Update local development documentation

### Phase 2: Testing & Validation (Week 2)
- Run comprehensive test suite on Node.js 20
- Performance benchmarking against current runtime
- Validate all MCP server integrations
- Test Spotify API integration thoroughly

### Phase 3: Staging Deployment (Week 3)
- Deploy to staging environment with Node.js 20
- Monitor performance metrics and error rates
- Validate recommendation engine performance
- Test real-time features and WebSocket connections

### Phase 4: Production Rollout (Week 4)
- Gradual production deployment with canary releases
- Monitor system health and performance metrics
- Rollback plan if critical issues detected
- Documentation updates for deployment procedures

## Risks and Mitigations

### Compatibility Risks
- **Risk**: Third-party dependencies may not support Node.js 20
- **Mitigation**: Audit all dependencies and update to compatible versions

### Performance Risks
- **Risk**: Potential performance regression in specific use cases
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive benchmarking and gradual rollout with monitoring

### Operational Risks
- **Risk**: Production deployment issues
- **Mitigation**: Extensive staging testing and rollback procedures

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dependencies

### Updated Dependencies
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "20.x",
    "npm": ">=10.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Dockerfile Updates
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS base
# Updated base image
```

### GitHub Actions Updates
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node-version: [20.x]
# Simplified matrix for Node.js 20 only
```

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (< 1 hour)
1. Revert Docker images to previous Node.js version
2. Rollback environment variable configurations
3. Monitor system recovery

### Code Rollback (< 4 hours)
1. Revert package.json engines field
2. Rollback CI/CD configurations
3. Redeploy previous stable version

### Data Integrity
- No data migrations required
- All data formats remain compatible
- API contracts unchanged

## Success Metrics

### Performance KPIs
- **Latency**: P95 response time ≤ 400ms (current budget)
- **Throughput**: ≥ 100 RPS sustained load
- **Memory**: Baseline usage < 512MB
- **CPU**: Average utilization < 70%

### Quality KPIs
