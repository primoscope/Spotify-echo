# ü§ñ EchoTune AI - Copilot Slash Commands

## Overview

The EchoTune AI repository now includes an advanced slash command system that allows authorized users to easily trigger Copilot SWE agent functions through simple commands in GitHub issues and pull requests.

## How It Works

Simply type a slash command in any issue or PR comment, and the system will automatically:

1. **Parse the command** and extract parameters
2. **Execute the requested function** (documentation generation, code analysis, etc.)
3. **Generate the requested content** using AI and project-specific templates
4. **Post results as comments** with rich formatting and helpful information
5. **Commit generated files** automatically to the repository

### üí° Command Features

#### üéØ Scope Parameters
Most commands accept optional scope parameters to focus analysis:
- **Directory Scope**: `/perplexity-analyze scripts/` - Focus on specific directories
- **Component Scope**: `/perplexity-analyze frontend` - Focus on frontend components  
- **Topic Scope**: `/perplexity-research "API security"` - Focus on specific topics

#### üí∞ Budget Awareness
Perplexity commands automatically optimize for cost efficiency:
