# Phase 2 Scaffold Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the rollout strategy for Phase 2 of the EchoTune AI hybrid recommendation system, introducing essential infrastructure for feedback ingestion, experimentation, PWA capabilities, and comprehensive observability.

## Scope of Changes

### Documentation & Governance
- `docs/planning/PHASE2_SCAFFOLD_PR_PLAN.md` - This planning document
- `docs/adr/ADR-003-event-feedback-ingestion.md` - Event feedback architecture
- `docs/adr/ADR-004-feature-flags-and-experiments.md` - Experimentation framework
- `docs/adr/ADR-005-observability-strategy.md` - Monitoring and observability
- `docs/adr/ADR-006-model-artifact-integrity.md` - Model validation and integrity
- `docs/feature-store/FEATURE_STORE_DESIGN.md` - Feature store architecture

### Infrastructure Scaffolding
- `observability/dashboards/` - 5 Grafana dashboard JSON stubs
- `reco/` - Recommendation engine components placeholder
- `events/` - Event ingestion system placeholder
- `experiments/` - A/B testing framework placeholder
- `pwa/` - Progressive Web App offline capabilities placeholder

### CI/CD Workflows
- `.github/workflows/build-test.yml` - Core build and test pipeline
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` - Security scanning and auditing
- `.github/workflows/sbom.yml` - Software bill of materials generation
- `.github/workflows/performance-benchmark.yml` - Performance testing
- `.github/workflows/experiment-gating.yml` - Experiment validation
- `.github/workflows/model-validation.yml` - Model artifact validation
- `.github/workflows/canary-deploy.yml` - Canary deployment automation

### Support Scripts
All scripts will be created as stubs with TODO markers:
- `scripts/gate-scripts/` - Quality gates for CI/CD
- `scripts/validation/` - Checksum and drift detection
- `scripts/deployment/` - Canary metrics and warmup
- `scripts/testing/` - Coverage and performance gates

## Rollout Strategy

### Phase 2.1: Infrastructure Setup (This PR)
- [ ] Establish directory structure and placeholder modules
- [ ] Create ADR documentation framework
- [ ] Setup CI/CD pipeline scaffolding
- [ ] Implement feature flag infrastructure (disabled by default)
- [ ] Create observability dashboard templates

### Phase 2.2: Component Implementation (Follow-up PRs)
- [ ] Implement collaborative filtering trainer
- [ ] Add content feature embedder
- [ ] Create hybrid blending algorithm
- [ ] Build trending detector job
- [ ] Implement feedback event enrichment

### Phase 2.3: Experimentation & PWA (Follow-up PRs)
- [ ] Full experiment evaluation with guardrails
- [ ] PWA push notifications and background sync
- [ ] Feature store implementation and benchmarking
- [ ] Advanced caching and performance optimization

## Feature Flag Strategy

All new functionality will be controlled by feature flags:

```javascript
const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  HYBRID_RECOMMENDATIONS: process.env.ENABLE_HYBRID_RECO || 'false',
  FEEDBACK_INGESTION: process.env.ENABLE_FEEDBACK_EVENTS || 'false',
  EXPERIMENT_FRAMEWORK: process.env.ENABLE_EXPERIMENTS || 'false',
  PWA_OFFLINE: process.env.ENABLE_PWA_OFFLINE || 'false',
  ENHANCED_OBSERVABILITY: process.env.ENABLE_ENHANCED_MONITORING || 'false'
};
```

## Quality Gates

### Coverage Requirements
- New code coverage threshold: 70%
- Existing code coverage maintained
- Integration test coverage for critical paths

### Security Requirements
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (pip-audit, Bandit, Trivy)
- SAST scanning for all new code
- SBOM generation and license compliance

### Performance Requirements
- No regression in existing API response times
- Memory usage within defined limits
- Database query performance maintained

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Workflow failures due to missing scripts | Provide stub scripts returning success/placeholder output |
| Over-scoped initial PR | Keep only scaffolding & stubs; defer real logic |
| Broken dashboards due to metric drift | Document metric naming conventions in ADR-005 |
| Feature flag bypasses | Strict validation in CI/CD pipelines |
| Database schema conflicts | Use feature-flag-gated migrations |

## Success Criteria

### For This PR
- [ ] All listed files present and syntactically valid
- [ ] Workflows run successfully on PR branch
- [ ] ADRs marked as "Proposed" status
- [ ] Dashboards loadable with proper schema
- [ ] No runtime activation of unfinished features
- [ ] All scripts return success exit codes

### Post-Merge Validation
- [ ] Feature flags properly control new endpoints
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards show baseline metrics
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines execute without errors
- [ ] No impact on existing functionality

## Follow-up Issues

After merge, the following issues will be created:

1. **Recommendation Engine Implementation**
   - Collaborative filtering algorithm
   - Content-based feature extraction
   - Hybrid blending with diversity/recency

2. **Event System Implementation**
   - Real-time feedback ingestion
   - Event enrichment pipeline
   - Dead letter queue handling

3. **Experimentation Platform**
   - Multi-metric evaluation
   - Statistical significance testing
   - Automated guardrails

4. **PWA Enhancement**
   - Offline caching strategies
   - Background synchronization
   - Push notification system

5. **Feature Store Implementation**
   - Redis/chosen store implementation
   - Feature serving optimization
   - Performance benchmarking

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Infrastructure and scaffolding (this PR)
- **Week 2-3**: Core recommendation algorithms
- **Week 4-5**: Event ingestion and experimentation
- **Week 6-7**: PWA and feature store implementation
- **Week 8**: Performance optimization and production readiness

## Notes

- All new code includes comprehensive error handling
- Logging follows established patterns with structured formats
- API contracts maintain backward compatibility
- Database migrations are reversible
- Monitoring includes both business and technical metrics
