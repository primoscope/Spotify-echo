## UI Agent

- Current Focus (2025â€‘08â€‘16):
  - Advanced AI Integration: Provider quick-switch in chat, provider badge.
  - Smart Music Discovery: Mood sliders + mini feature visualization (client-only).
  - Analytics Dashboard: Compact sparkline widgets for top metrics (client-only).
  - Advanced Configuration: Minor glass UI polish; no API changes.

- Next UI Tasks:
  1) EnhancedChatInterface.jsx: add provider quick-switch using `useLLM()`; show current provider chip.
  2) EnhancedMusicDiscovery.jsx: add client-only radar/sparkline for `moodSettings` values.
  3) EnhancedAnalyticsDashboard.jsx: add sparkline components for overview metrics using mock fallback data.
  5) EnhancedChatInterface.jsx: add Providers health and average latency chips using `/api/providers/health` and `/api/settings/llm-providers/telemetry` (DONE)

**Status**: âœ… **PRODUCTION READY**
**Next Steps**: Quality improvements, observability enhancements, and stretch goal planning

## Automation

This roadmap is supported by automated tooling for better project management:

### Roadmap Index Generation
- **Script**: `scripts/roadmap/build_index.js` - Automatically parses roadmap files and generates structured JSON index
- **Usage**: `npm run roadmap:index` - Generates `generated/roadmap_index.json` with all backlog items
- **Features**: Parses both markdown tables and bullet lists, extracts metadata, tracks phases and progress
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions workflow generates and publishes roadmap index as downloadable artifact
- **Benefits**: Enables dashboard integration, automated reporting, and programmatic roadmap analysis

The index script scans this file and other roadmap documents to create a comprehensive JSON artifact containing all planned and completed items with their metadata, making roadmap data accessible for dashboards, reports, and automation systems.
