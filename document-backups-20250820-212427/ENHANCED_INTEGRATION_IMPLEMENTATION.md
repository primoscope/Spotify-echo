/run-mcp-validation          # Standard validation
/mcp-health-check            # Quick health check
/mcp-discover               # Discover new servers

# GPT-5 Commands  
/analyze-gpt5 [target]       # Trigger analysis
/review-gpt5 [target]        # Code review
/optimize-gpt5 [target]      # Optimization

# Admin Commands
/approve-merge              # Override validation
/force-validation           # Force comprehensive check
```

### 4. Enhanced Documentation & Instructions

**New Documentation:**
- ✅ **Enhanced Integration Guide**: `docs/ENHANCED_GPT5_MCP_INTEGRATION.md`
- ✅ **Updated Copilot Instructions**: Enhanced with new commands and validation requirements
- ✅ **Workflow Integration Diagrams**: Visual representation of validation flow
- ✅ **Command Reference**: Comprehensive usage guide

**Key Documentation Features:**
- Complete command reference with examples
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Workflow integration flow diagrams  
- Role-based usage guidelines
- Monitoring and analytics information

### 5. Legacy Workflow Migration

**Updated Files:**
- ✅ **Legacy Copilot Models**: Updated to redirect to enhanced workflow
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains support for existing commands
- ✅ **Migration Notices**: Clear guidance for users on new features

## 🛡️ Pre-Merge Validation Gateway

### Activation Triggers
The validation gateway automatically activates for:
- **Copilot/Agent PRs**: Any PR from copilot or github-actions[bot]
- **Labeled PRs**: `copilot-coding-agent`, `needs-mcp-validation`, `gpt5-analysis`
- **File-Based Detection**: Changes to MCP files, automation scripts, workflows
- **Manual Activation**: `/force-validation` command

### Validation Flow
```
PR Created → Classification → Validation Gate → Comprehensive Checks → Merge Decision
     ↓
Copilot PR → Required Validation → All Checks → Pass = Auto-Merge Ready
     ↓                                    ↓
Standard PR → Standard Review            Fail = Merge Blocked
```

### Merge Gating Logic
- ✅ **Auto-Merge Ready**: All MCP + GPT validations pass
- ❌ **Merge Blocked**: Critical failures detected, issues must be resolved
- ⏳ **Validation Pending**: Comprehensive checks running
- 🔓 **Admin Override**: Manual approval bypasses validation

## 📊 Status Reporting & Integration

### Unified PR Comments
All workflows now post consolidated status comments including:
- 🛡️ Validation Gateway Status
- 🤖 GPT-5 Analysis Results  
- 📊 MCP Integration Status
- 🔄 Available Commands
- 🚀 Merge Readiness Indicators

### Enhanced Status Checks
- `MCP Validation Gateway / Auto-Merge Ready` ✅
- `MCP Validation Gateway / Merge Blocked` ❌  
- `Enhanced GPT-5 + MCP Validation Gateway` (Combined)
- Individual component checks for detailed tracking

### Command Integration
- **Cross-Workflow Triggers**: Commands can trigger multiple workflows
- **Context Preservation**: Commands maintain PR/issue context
- **Result Aggregation**: All results consolidated in unified reports
