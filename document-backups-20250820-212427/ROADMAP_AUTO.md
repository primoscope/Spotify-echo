# EchoTune AI — Auto-Refreshed Roadmap

Generated: 2025-08-16T07:03:44.364Z

## How to use this document
- This roadmap is auto-updated using Perplexity Sonar‑Pro and Grok‑4.
- For browser research inside Cursor, run the workflow: `.cursor/workflows/perplexity-browser-research.json`.
- For PR reviews, use `.cursor/workflows/pr-deep-dive.json`.

## Executive Summary (Sonar‑Pro)

EchoTune AI should prioritize the following roadmap steps to maximize Perplexity integration, CI efficiency, Cursor workflows, and security:

**1. Perplexity Integration**
- Ensure robust connection to the Perplexity endpoint using MCP server standards for real-time web research and data retrieval[3][5].
- Validate API authentication and environment variables (e.g., `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`) for secure, reliable access[5].
- Document integration flows for maintainability and onboarding.

**2. CI Optimization**
- Maintain and monitor CI caches and canary deployments for rapid, reliable builds and early detection of integration issues.
- Automate tests for Perplexity endpoint health and response accuracy.
- Integrate security checks into CI (e.g., dependency scanning, secret detection).

**3. Cursor Workflows**
- Leverage Cursor’s task management and automation features to streamline development and code review processes[2][4].
- Enable agents to use Perplexity for live API documentation and code search directly within Cursor[2].
- Establish parallel workflow phases (e.g., backend/frontend) and automated code reviews for quality assurance[4].

**4. Security**
- Enforce API key management and rotation policies for Perplexity and related integrations[5].
- Audit access controls and monitor for unauthorized usage.
- Integrate security testing into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., SAST, DAST).

**Prioritization Table**

| Priority | Area                | Key Actions                                                                 |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Perplexity Integration | Secure, document, and validate MCP/API flows                              |
| 2        | CI Optimization        | Automate tests, monitor canary, integrate security checks                 |
| 3        | Cursor Workflows       | Streamline tasks, enable live search, automate code reviews               |
| 4        | Security               | Enforce key management, audit access, integrate security testing          |

Focus first on **Perplexity integration and security**, as these underpin reliability and trust, then optimize CI and Cursor workflows for developer productivity and code quality.

## Architectural Deep‑Dive (Grok‑4)

EchoTune AI leverages a **Node.js + React stack** with MCP servers, Vite, Jest, Redis, and MongoDB, organized into modular directories for API, authentication, chat, ML, and more. The architecture is robust but can be enhanced for scalability, security, and maintainability.

**Architectural Assessment**

- **Strengths**
  - **Modular Directory Structure:** Clear separation of concerns (e.g., `api`, `auth`, `chat`, `ml`, `mcp`, `middleware`, `security`) supports maintainability and extensibility.
  - **MCP Integration:** Use of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers enables persistent, contextual AI interactions and bridges external systems securely[1][5].
  - **Modern Tooling:** Vite for fast builds, Jest for testing, Redis for caching, and MongoDB for flexible data storage.
  - **Script Automation:** Extensive scripts for data analysis, validation, and automation streamline development and operations.

- **Potential Weaknesses**
  - **Monolithic Tendencies:** Despite modular directories, tightly coupled logic across backend/frontend and MCP servers may hinder independent scaling and deployment.
  - **Security Surface:** Multiple integration points (e.g., MCP, Redis, MongoDB, browser research workflows) increase attack vectors; robust access controls and validation are essential[2][5].
  - **Testing Coverage:** While Jest is present, comprehensive integration and security testing for MCP workflows and external APIs should be verified.
  - **Containerization & Deployment:** No explicit mention of Docker/Kubernetes; lack of containerization can impede reproducibility and scalability[2][4][5].
  - **Type Safety:** If TypeScript is not used, runtime errors and maintenance costs may increase[3].

**Recommendations**

- **Adopt Microservices Architecture**
  - Refactor tightly coupled modules (e.g., `auth`, `chat`, `ml`, `mcp`) into independent services with dedicated APIs and databases for scalability and fault isolation[4].
- **Containerize All Services**
  - Use Docker for each major component (Node.js backend, React frontend, MCP servers) to ensure consistent environments and simplify deployment[2][4][5].
- **Enhance Security**
  - Implement strict access controls, input validation (e.g., Zod), and regular security audits for all MCP endpoints and integrations[2][5].
  - Isolate sensitive services (e.g., `security`, `database`, `auth`) in separate containers or VMs.
- **Increase Type Safety**
  - Migrate backend code to TypeScript for better maintainability and error prevention[3].
- **Optimize Testing**
  - Expand Jest coverage to include integration, security, and performance tests for MCP workflows and external APIs.
  - Automate CI/CD pipelines for continuous validation (`ci` scripts).
- **Improve Observability**
  - Integrate advanced logging (e.g., Winston) and monitoring for all MCP servers and backend services[3].
- **Leverage Cloud Scalability**
  - Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS/Azure) for elastic scaling, especially for MCP workloads and data-heavy operations[5].
- **Documentation & Onboarding**
  - Maintain up-to-date README files and architectural decision records (ADR) for each major directory and workflow.

**Summary Table**

| Area                | Current State                | Recommendation                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Modularity          | Good (modular dirs)         | Refactor to microservices            |
| Containerization    | Not explicit                | Dockerize all services               |
| Security            | Multiple integration points | Harden access, validate inputs       |
| Type Safety         | Not specified               | Migrate to TypeScript                |
| Testing             | Jest present                | Expand to integration/security tests |
| Observability       | Basic                       | Add advanced logging/monitoring      |
| Scalability         | Manual                      | Cloud deployment, auto-scaling       |
| Documentation       | Present                     | Keep ADRs and onboarding guides      |

Implementing these recommendations will strengthen EchoTune AI’s architecture for scalability, security, and maintainability, ensuring robust AI-driven workflows and integrations.
