# MCP Sample Prompts for Coding Agents

This document provides sample prompts and usage patterns for GitHub Coding Agents using the MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers configured in EchoTune AI.

## üöÄ Getting Started

After setting up MCP servers with `npm run mcp:install`, you can use these prompts with your coding agent (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude, etc.).

"Find open source music recommendation systems and analyze their architectures"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Environment Setup
```
"Help me set up a new development environment by checking all required dependencies and environment variables"

"Validate that all API keys are properly configured and test the Spotify API connection"

"Set up the database schema and run any necessary migrations"
```

### Testing & Debugging
```
"Run the test suite and analyze any failing tests, then suggest fixes"

"Debug the authentication flow by tracing through the OAuth implementation"

"Test the recommendation engine with sample data and analyze the results"
```

### Deployment Preparation
```
"Check the application for production readiness, including security, performance, and monitoring"

"Generate a deployment checklist with all required environment variables and dependencies"

"Review the Docker configuration and suggest improvements for production deployment"
```

## üéµ Music-Specific Operations

### Spotify Integration
```
"Analyze my Spotify listening history CSV files and identify patterns in my music preferences"

"Create a new playlist recommendation algorithm based on audio features like tempo and energy"

"Implement a feature to sync playlists between the app and Spotify"
```

### Audio Analysis
```
"Process the audio features data to identify clusters of similar songs"

"Generate visualizations of music preference trends over time"

"Create a mood-based music filtering system using audio features"
```

### Machine Learning
```
"Improve the collaborative filtering model by implementing matrix factorization"

"Add support for content-based filtering using song metadata and audio features"

"Create a hybrid recommendation system that combines multiple approaches"
```

## üìä Data & Analytics

### Database Operations
```
"Optimize the MongoDB queries for fetching user listening history and generate performance metrics"

"Create database indexes to improve query performance for recommendation generation"

"Migrate the listening history data from CSV files to MongoDB with proper validation"
```

### Data Analysis
```
"Analyze the correlation between audio features and user preferences in the dataset"

"Generate insights about music discovery patterns from the user interaction data"

"Create a dashboard showing key metrics for the recommendation system performance"
```

## üîÑ Advanced Workflows

### Multi-Step Operations
```
"Help me implement a complete user authentication system: 1) Update the database schema, 2) Create API endpoints, 3) Add frontend components, 4) Write tests, 5) Update documentation"

"Guide me through adding a new music service integration: 1) Research their API, 2) Create the service class, 3) Add authentication flow, 4) Test the integration, 5) Update the UI"
```

### Cross-Platform Development
```
"Create a mobile-responsive version of the playlist interface that works well on both desktop and mobile"

"Implement Progressive Web App features to make the music app work offline"
```

## üéØ Context-Aware Prompts

### Using Project Knowledge
```
"Based on the existing EchoTune AI architecture, suggest the best approach to add real-time collaborative playlists"

"Considering our current MongoDB schema and Spotify API integration, how should we implement playlist versioning?"

"Given the existing React component structure, create a new component for music visualization that fits the current design patterns"
```

### Sequential Development
```
"Let's build a new feature step by step:
1. First, help me understand the requirements for social playlist sharing
2. Then design the database changes needed
3. Create the backend API endpoints
4. Build the frontend components
5. Add appropriate tests
6. Update the documentation"
```

## üí° Tips for Effective Prompts

### Be Specific
- ‚úÖ "Create a React component for playlist management with add, remove, and reorder functionality"
- ‚ùå "Create a playlist component"

### Provide Context
- ‚úÖ "Using the existing Spotify integration in src/services/spotify.js, add support for creating playlists"
- ‚ùå "Add playlist creation"

### Request Multiple Perspectives
- ‚úÖ "Analyze this code for both performance and security issues, and suggest improvements"
- ‚ùå "Fix this code"

### Ask for Explanations
- ‚úÖ "Explain why this approach is better than alternatives and what trade-offs we're making"
- ‚ùå "Implement this feature"

## üîß Troubleshooting Prompts

### When Things Go Wrong
```
"The Spotify authentication is failing - help me debug the OAuth flow and identify the issue"

"The recommendation engine is returning poor results - analyze the algorithm and suggest improvements"

"The React app is performing slowly with large playlists - identify bottlenecks and optimize"
```

### Learning & Improvement
```
"Explain the current architecture and suggest how we could make it more scalable"

"What modern development practices could we adopt to improve code quality?"

"How can we better structure our tests to improve coverage and reliability?"
```
