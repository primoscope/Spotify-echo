# Experiment Framework

This directory contains the A/B testing and experimentation framework for EchoTune AI.

## Structure

- `assignment/` - User assignment and bucketing logic
- `metrics/` - Experiment metrics collection and analysis
- `analysis/` - Statistical analysis and significance testing
- `dashboard/` - Experiment monitoring and reporting
- `guardrails/` - Safety guardrails and anomaly detection

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **Phase 2 Scaffolding** - Directory structure and placeholders created

### Planned Components

#### Feature Flag Service
- Centralized flag management
- Real-time flag updates
- User segment targeting
- Gradual rollout controls

#### Assignment Service
- Consistent user bucketing
- Deterministic assignment algorithm
- Cross-session consistency
- Multi-variant support

#### Metrics Collection
- Automated metric tracking
- Business and technical metrics
- Real-time aggregation
- Historical data storage

#### Statistical Analysis
- Sample size calculation
- Significance testing (t-test, chi-square)
- Bayesian analysis
- Confidence intervals

## Experiment Types

### A/B Tests
- Two-variant testing
- Control vs treatment
- Single metric optimization
- Simple statistical analysis

### Multi-variate Tests
- Multiple variants
- Multiple metrics
- Complex factorial designs
- Advanced statistical methods

### Feature Rollouts
- Gradual traffic increase
- Safety guardrails
- Automated rollback
- Performance monitoring

## Feature Flags

All components are controlled by feature flags:
- `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTS`: Enable experimentation framework
- `ENABLE_FEATURE_FLAGS`: Enable feature flag service
- `ENABLE_STATISTICAL_ANALYSIS`: Enable statistical testing
- `ENABLE_AUTOMATED_GUARDRAILS`: Enable safety guardrails

## Quality Gates

### Statistical Requirements
- Minimum experiment duration: 7 days
- Statistical significance: p < 0.05
- Minimum sample size: 1000 users per variant
- Effect size detection: >1% relative change

### Safety Requirements
- Automated anomaly detection
- Performance guardrails
- Error rate monitoring
- User experience quality gates

## Next Steps

1. Implement feature flag service
2. Create user assignment logic
3. Build metrics collection system
4. Add statistical analysis framework
5. Create experiment dashboard
