# 🎉 Perplexity API Integration - FULLY OPERATIONAL

## ✅ Issue Resolution Summary

The user reported that the system was showing "Mock Perplexity response (no API key configured)" despite having configured the API key `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` in GitHub secrets.

### 🔍 Root Cause Identified
The `.env` file contained an **invalid/expired API key** (`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`) which was causing 401 Unauthorized responses from the Perplexity API.

### 🔧 Solution Implemented
1. **Updated `.env` file** with the correct API key provided by the user
2. **Enhanced API key detection** in JavaScript research service with better debugging
3. **Added missing `research()` method** to Python perplexity client
4. **Improved error handling** and fallback mechanisms
