# Roadmap Analysis Summary

## Current State Assessment

The roadmap demonstrates strong foundational progress with **API integrations** (Spotify, Perplexity), a basic recommendation engine, and database setup. In-progress tasks focus on **ML models, chat interface, authentication, and performance**. Planned features include **mobile app development, social features, and analytics**.

**Gaps identified:**
- No mention of **voice/chat multimodality**, **sentiment/contextual analysis**, or **LLM upgrades**.
- Lacks **enterprise integrations** (CRM, ERP), **compliance/security enhancements**, and **automation-focused agent features**.
- Missing **real-time analytics**, **multilingual support**, and **continuous learning pipelines**.
- Technology stack references are outdated; no mention of 2025 frameworks or agent orchestration tools.

## Recommended Updates

- **Prioritize multimodal and voice capabilities** to align with 2025 chatbot trends[1][5].
- **Upgrade ML/LLM models** to GPT-4.5 or equivalent for better contextual understanding and multilingual support[4][5].
- **Integrate sentiment/contextual analysis** for personalized experiences[1].
- **Expand automation** via coding agents for routine tasks, monitoring, and deployment[5].
- **Adopt modern frameworks** (Dialogflow, Rasa, OpenAI API) and orchestration tools (n8n, Voiceflow)[2][5].
- **Implement real-time analytics and feedback loops** for continuous improvement[3].
- **Add enterprise integrations** (CRM, ERP) for workflow automation[1][4].
- **Enhance security/compliance** for data handling, especially if scaling to regulated industries[4].
