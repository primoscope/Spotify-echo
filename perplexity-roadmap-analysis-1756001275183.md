Model: sonar-pro

The current roadmap has basic features implemented but lacks enhancements aligned with 2025 technology trends and best practices. To remain competitive and resilient, updates should focus on cloud-native scalability, security, automation, API-first design, and integration with modern platforms[1][4].

# Roadmap Analysis Summary

## Current State Assessment
- **Basic functionality exists** but lacks advanced features, automation, and integrations.
- **Repository insights** suggest opportunities for improvement but do not specify missing technologies or practices.
- **No clear alignment with 2025 best practices** such as cloud-native architecture, security-first development, and API-centric design[1][4].

## Recommended Updates
- **Adopt cloud-native, scalable technologies** for performance and flexibility[1].
- **Integrate automated testing and CI/CD pipelines** for faster, more reliable delivery[1][4].
- **Prioritize security from the start** to address evolving threats[1].
- **Shift to API-first development** for extensibility and easier integration[1].
- **Leverage coding agents for automation** in repetitive tasks and maintenance.
- **Regularly review and update the roadmap** to stay agile and responsive to market changes[2][3].
- **Collaborate cross-functionally** to align roadmap goals with business objectives and customer needs[3][5].

   - Document APIs using OpenAPI; refactor for modularity and scalability.
   - Success: All endpoints documented and accessible; ready for third-party integration.
   - Dependencies: Existing API codebase.

4. **[P1] Automated End-to-End Testing** – Deploy coding agents to generate and maintain test suites (Effort: Medium, Automation: High)
   - Use tools like Playwright or Cypress for UI/API testing.
   - Success: >90% coverage, tests run on every build.
   - Dependencies: CI/CD pipeline, test data.

5. **[P0] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation** – Enhance security with granular permissions (Effort: Medium, Automation: Medium)
   - Integrate RBAC using modern frameworks (e.g., OAuth2, Keycloak).
   - Success: User roles enforced across all endpoints.
   - Dependencies: User management system.

6. **[P1] Integrate Observability Stack** – Add logging, metrics, and tracing (Effort: Medium, Automation: High)
   - Use tools like OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana.
   - Success: Real-time monitoring and alerting for all services.
   - Dependencies: Cloud infrastructure, application code.

7. **[P2] Continuous Roadmap Review Automation** – Coding agent to analyze repo activity and suggest roadmap updates (Effort: Small, Automation: High)
   - Script reviews PRs, issues, and usage metrics; generates monthly roadmap suggestions.
   - Success: Automated summary delivered to PMs.
   - Dependencies: Repository access, analytics API.

8. **[P1] Integrate Third-Party Authentication** – Support SSO via OAuth2, Google, Microsoft (Effort: Medium, Automation: Medium)
   - Implement plug-and-play authentication modules.
   - Success: Users can log in with external providers.
   - Dependencies: API endpoints, user database.

9. **[P2] Implement Feature Flags** – Enable dynamic feature rollout and A/B testing (Effort: Small, Automation: High)
   - Use LaunchDarkly or open-source alternatives.
   - Success: Features toggled without redeployments.
   - Dependencies: Application codebase.

10. **[P1] Enhance Documentation Automation** – Coding agent to auto-generate API and architecture docs from codebase (Effort: Small, Automation: High)
    - Integrate tools like Swagger, DocFX.
    - Success: Documentation always up-to-date with code changes.
    - Dependencies: Repository access.

11. **[P2] Integrate Payment/Notification APIs** – Add Stripe for payments, Twilio for notifications (Effort: Medium, Automation: Medium)
    - Implement modular integration layers.
    - Success: Payment and notification workflows operational.
    - Dependencies: API keys, business logic.

12. **[P2] User Feedback Collection Automation** – Coding agent to aggregate and analyze user feedback from multiple channels (Effort: Small, Automation: High)
    - Connect to feedback forms, emails, and support tickets.
    - Success: Monthly actionable insights report.
    - Dependencies: Access to feedback sources.

These tasks leverage 2025 best practices, prioritize security, scalability, and automation, and are structured for immediate implementation by coding agents[1][4][5].
