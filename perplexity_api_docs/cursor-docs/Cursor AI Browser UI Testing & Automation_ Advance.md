   - Create separate .cursor/rules/ files for frontend, backend, and testing workflows
   - Test YOLO mode with appropriate safety parameters for automated code execution
   - Configure model switching between GPT-4, Claude, and Grok-4 based on task complexity

2. **Browser Research Integration Testing**:
   - Set up Perplexity API integration for real-time web research during development
   - Create automated workflow that uses @web context to fetch latest documentation
   - Test browser automation using Playwright MCP for UI testing scenarios
   - Implement automated code review system that cross-references online best practices

3. **Advanced Workflow Automation**:
   - Create agent mode workflows for multi-file refactoring with automatic testing
   - Set up continuous integration prompts that automatically update project roadmaps
