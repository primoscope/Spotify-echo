# Recommendation Engine Module

This directory contains the hybrid recommendation engine components for EchoTune AI.

## Structure

- `algorithms/` - Core recommendation algorithms (collaborative, content-based, hybrid)
- `models/` - Machine learning model artifacts and versioning
- `features/` - Feature extraction and vector management
- `serving/` - Real-time recommendation serving API
- `training/` - Model training and evaluation pipelines

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **Phase 2 Scaffolding** - Directory structure and placeholders created

### Planned Components

#### Collaborative Filtering
- User-based collaborative filtering
- Item-based collaborative filtering
- Matrix factorization (SVD, NMF)
- Deep learning collaborative filtering

#### Content-Based Filtering
- Audio feature analysis
- Genre and mood classification
- Artist similarity computation
- Lyrical content analysis

#### Hybrid Algorithm
- Weighted ensemble methods
- Switching hybrid approaches
- Mixed recommendation strategies
- Context-aware blending

## Feature Flags

All components are controlled by feature flags:
- `ENABLE_HYBRID_RECO`: Enable hybrid recommendation engine
- `ENABLE_COLLABORATIVE_FILTERING`: Enable collaborative filtering algorithms
- `ENABLE_CONTENT_BASED`: Enable content-based filtering
- `ENABLE_DEEP_LEARNING`: Enable deep learning models

## Next Steps

1. Implement collaborative filtering trainer
2. Add content feature embedder  
3. Create hybrid blending algorithm
4. Build trending detector job
5. Add real-time serving capabilities
